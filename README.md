## How the game works

1. User buys in "money" into the machine with choices of $5, $10 & $20.
1. User can then place bet with a minimum of $0.25 per bet to a max of $2.00 per bet.
    * User can increse their bet by increments of $0.25 or if they choose to bet the max bet of $2.00, they may press the 'Max Bet' button to go straight to a $2.00 bet.
1. User will click spin to start the game and according to the results of the slot machine, the user will either win with 3 of a kind images or 2 of a kind from the first 2 reels (left to right). If the results are neither, the player has lost the bet they placed. (winning condition payouts will be placed on on the right side of the screen)
